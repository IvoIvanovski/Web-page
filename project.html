        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <h2>Stop Watch</h2>
        <p>After finishing my online courses for HTML, CSS and JavaScript where I have 
            done some very small projects, I was trying to create my first small project, creating stopwatch.
            For a begginer I was good at HTML, after some trying I finished CSS, but for 
            JavaScript coding I manageded to do more than a half codes, but I needed help from youtube 
            tutorials in order to put my functions in order. If you want to see my first project 
            click <a href="file:///D:/proekti/indexstopwatch.html">here</a> or you can click on image on the right.</p>
            <img class="stopwatch" src="D:/proekti/stopwatch.jpg" alt="stopwatch" 
            onclick="window.location.href='file:///D:/proekti/indexstopwatch.html'"/>
        
        <h2>Analog Clock</h2>
        <p>I've done my second project with a little bit a more confidence, but I needed help form 
            internet souces for JavaScript. I suppose that is the way to learn more and get better, by seeng 
            others how they managed to write codes, I learn for them and i now that this takes time and a lot
            of practicing. I do not copy the code, I just see the functions, methods, variables and then I try 
            to do things by myself. Sometimes it works from firs see, somethimes I check again. 
            You can see my analog watch <a href="file:///C:/coding/.vscode/htmlclock.html">here</a> or you can click on image.</p>
            <img class="analog" src="C:\Users\hp\Downloads\portfolio\analog.jpg" alt="analog"
            onclick="window.location.href='file:///C:/coding/.vscode/htmlclock.html'"/> 
    
        <h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
        <p>For my third project, I wanted to create something more challenging, Tic Tac Toe game. I thought that
            I was finally get a hang of CSS, but I strugled in order to create X and 0 to be perfect, 
            I didn't want to create them in HTML.
            Not only that, I never thought that I must write a lot of CSS designs and styles to look great.
            After that, I found that this ordinary basic simple game demand great knowelledge of JavaScript. 
            Finally, I finished this with help and you can see my Tic Tac 
            Toe game <a href="file:///C:/coding/.vscode/tictactoe.html">here</a> or you can click on image.</p>
            <img class="tictactoe" src="C:\Users\hp\Downloads\portfolio\tictactoe.jpg" alt="tictactoe"
            onclick="window.location.href='file:///C:/coding/.vscode/tictactoe.html'"/> 
    
        <h2>Personal Portfolio</h2>
        <p>After some time developing some web sites with multiple pages where some of them are basic 
            but some of them are higly dinamic and complex (I'm still working on them), I was eager to
            create my personal portfolio web site in order to show my future employeers or clients and 
            partners who I'm
